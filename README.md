# Data Mining Project

## Overview
This project focuses on data mining techniques to extract meaningful patterns and insights from large datasets. The core implementation is provided in the Jupyter Notebook [`DataMining-MehranAlamBeigi.ipynb`](https://github.com/Mehranalam/super-carnival/blob/main/DataMining-MehranAlamBeigi.ipynb), which includes various data preprocessing, exploration, and modeling methods.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
- **Classification & Clustering**: Implementing supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and clustering scores.

## Algorithm & Development Process
The project applies various data mining methodologies, including:
1. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Removing inconsistencies and preparing data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using statistical and visualization tools to understand data trends.
3. **Supervised Learning**: Training classification models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM.
4. **Unsupervised Learning**: Applying clustering techniques like K-Means and DBSCAN.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Measuring accuracy, F1-score, and clustering quality metrics.
6. **Optimization & Feature Selection**: Improving model performance through hyperparameter tuning.

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mehranalam/super-carnival.git
   cd super-carnival
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook DataMining-MehranAlamBeigi.ipynb
   ```
3. Execute the cells step by step to preprocess data, apply models, and analyze results.

## Results
The notebook provides:
- Cleaned and processed dataset
- Data visualizations for exploratory analysis
- Performance evaluation of classification and clustering models

## Future Work
- Enhance feature selection techniques for better model accuracy.
- Explore deep learning approaches for data mining.
- Apply the methodology to larger and more complex datasets.
